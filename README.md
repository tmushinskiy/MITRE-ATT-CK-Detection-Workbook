# MITRE ATT&CK Detection Workbook

## Objective

The MITRE ATT&CK Detection Workbook project focuses on mapping and detecting adversary behaviors using the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This project involves analyzing attack techniques, developing detection rules, and testing telemetry to understand how threat actors operate. The goal is to enhance threat detection by applying structured analysis and aligning SOC monitoring efforts with known TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures).

### Skills Learned

- Deep understanding of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and its application in threat detection.  
- Ability to analyze and correlate attack techniques with log data.  
- Development of detection rules based on known adversary behaviors.  
- Use of ATT&CK Navigator to map coverage and identify gaps.  
- Log enrichment and tuning for better visibility and alert quality.  

### Tools Used

- MITRE ATT&CK Navigator (for mapping and visualization of detection coverage)  
- Sigma Rules (for writing detection rules across platforms)  
- Sysmon (endpoint telemetry generation and logging)  
- Windows Event Viewer (log collection and analysis)  
- Elastic Stack or Splunk Free (for log ingestion, search, and visualization)  
- Atomic Red Team or CALDERA (for simulating ATT&CK techniques in test environments)
